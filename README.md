## **What framework did you pick and why?**

I have chosen Vue to build this project.

The reason why I chose Vue is that Vue is a popular JavaScript framework that is used to build user interfaces and single-page applications. The advantages of **Vue** are the following:

1. Easy to learn: Vue's learning curve is relatively low, making it a great choice for beginners as well as developers looking for prototypes that can be built quickly.
2. Lightweight: Vue is a lightweight framework that's easy to set up and has a small file size, so it's ideal for fast and responsive projects.
3. Reactive data binding: Reactive data binding allows changes in the data to be reflected immediately in the UI, making it easy to maintain consistency between the view and the data.
4. Component-based architecture: Vue's component-based architecture makes it easy to reuse code and build complex applications from simple building blocks.
5. Versatility: Vue can be used for both small and large-scale projects, and can be integrated with other frameworks and libraries.
6. Performance: Vue's virtual DOM implementation is efficient, updating only the parts of the DOM that are necessary, resulting in faster rendering times.
7. Strong community support: The Vue community provides support, documentation, and a variety of plugins and extensions.

As a powerful and flexible framework, Vue offers many benefits when I build this project.

## **What about that framework appealed to you, for this project?**

For this project I am going to build a todolist website and the reason I choose Vue is following:

1. Vue framework is lightweight and easy to learn. With its simple and concise syntax, it is ideal for small to this projects a simple to-do list.
2. During coding, whenever the data and the code changes, Vue updates the view automatically due to its unique feature. By eliminating the need to manually update the view, the development process becomes faster and more efficient.
3. With Vue, I can easily break down the whole project into smaller, reusable components thanks to its component-based architecture. Reusability and code organization are improved as a result. For example, in the todolist I can wirte a component display unfinished task in a table and reuse it for finished task.
4. Vue. supports templates, which makes it easy to create and manage user interfaces. It is easy to create templates for to-do list items, and the framework will render them for me.
5. Vue has extensive documentation, making it easy to get started with the framework and there are tons of external library to use.

The Vue framework is easy-to-use, lightweight, and flexible, making it ideal for small and medium-sized projects, such as to-do lists.

## **What alternative frameworks did you consider?**

For this project, I am also considering using React and Angular.

Firstly, between Vue and React. It is generally believed that Vue.js has a lower learning curve than React.js, making it easier for beginners to learn. It is also more flexible to structure application with Vue.js, while React.js is more opinionated. Unlike React.js, Vue.js supports two-way data binding, which will make it easier when user enter that task for the todolist and save them. Compared to React.js, Vue.js has a simpler and more concise syntax, making it easier to read and write code.

The second, I also considered Angular. Compared to Angular, Vue.js is generally more lightweight and easier to learn. Different**to** Angular, Vue.js has a simpler and more flexible architecture, which makes developing and maintaining applications easier. In smaller applications, Vue.js has better performance and faster rendering times than Angular when Angular offers a larger ecosystem and more built-in features than Vue.js, which is advantageous for larger and more complex applications.

However, the choice between Vue.js, React.js, and Angular depends has different advantages and disadvantages. In smaller to med**ium-sized pr**ojects that require a flexible and easy-to-learn framework, vue.js is a great choice.

## **What resources did you read/watch/listen to?**

Here is some resources I read:

1. Vue.js official documentation: Vue.js official documentation is a comprehensive resource that provides detailed information about the Vue.js framework. It covers all aspects of Vue.js, including its core features, directives, components, and plugins. The documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate, with clear examples and explanations that make it easy for developers to understand and use the framework. It also includes guides on best practices, performance optimization, and advanced features such as server-side rendering and Vuex. The Vue.js official documentation is regularly updated and maintained by the Vue.js team, ensuring that it is always up-to-date with the latest features and best practices. Overall, the Vue.js official documentation is an essential resource for anyone looking to learn and use Vue.js for their projects.
2. Vue Mastery: Vue Mastery is an online learning platform that offers a range of courses and tutorials on Vue.js. Their courses cover topics such as Vue.js fundamentals, components, and routing. They also offer a free "Introduction to Vue 3" course. Vue Mastery is a great resource for anyone looking to learn Vue.js, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.
3. Vue.js Developers: Vue.js Developers is a community of Vue.js developers that offers tutorials, articles, and resources on Vue.js. They cover a wide range of topics, including Vue.js fundamentals, components, and Vuex. They also have a job board and a newsletter, making it a great resource for anyone looking to stay up-to-date with Vue.js developments.
4. BalmUI: BalmUI is a component library for Vue.js that provides a set of customizable UI components for building web applications. The BalmUI official documentation provides comprehensive documentation on all the available components, along with examples and code snippets that developers can use to quickly integrate them into their projects. The documentation also includes guides on best practices, customization options, and how to use BalmUI with other Vue.js plugins and libraries. The BalmUI official documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate, making it a great resource for developers looking to improve the UI and UX of their Vue.js web applications. Overall, the BalmUI official documentation is a valuable resource for Vue.js developers looking to enhance their web applications with high-quality UI components.

## **Describe the site you built for this assignment. What does it do? What components or features of the framework did you explore for this project**

This to-do list website is an application that allows users to create a list of tasks or items they need to complete. The website allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

For this project, the components and features I used are:

1. Components: Vue.js is known for its component-based architecture. In a to-do list website, I have created header and list components. The header components allow users to enter their tasks, select the due date of the task and write a more detailed description of the task. The list component displays the unfinished and completed tasks in tables so that the user can click the check box to complete the task.
2. To maintain design consistency I use BalmUI for button and table components. BalmUI is a component library for Vue.js that provides a set of customizable UI components for building web applications.
3. Lifecycle methods: Vue.js has lifecycle methods that allow you to execute code at specific points in the component lifecycle. This makes it easy to perform tasks such as initializing data, handling events, and cleaning up resources.
4. Data binding: Vue.js supports two-way data binding, which means that changes to the data model are reflected in the view and vice versa. This allows me to create dynamic and reactive user interfaces that update in real-time as data changes. For example, the content and the state of tasks can be changed immediately due to this feature.
